# journey-through-radiations
Prototype for educational tool that uses radiation information from the Canadian Space Agency to create a story for students to understand its effect on their health

Created with Shashikanth Kri during the Space Apps hackathon 2019. We deal with RadiN2 challenge. Won the RadiN2 challenge for the Waterloo chapter, qualifying for nationals.

Ideas for improvements:
1. Retain DOS interface. 
2. Add more variables for calculating their combined impact on the player's health, such as air pollution index, water pollution, etc. 
3. Create story "turning points" or "landmarks" for each variables & option combination that involves real life events. Use neural networks to automatically create a story line depending on these hinges. 
4. Add a positive health feature. Currently, the game is a little "everything sucks and everything will hurt you". Add positive influences of activities, for e.g. positive results of environmental policies of cities, or good values of pollution indices, etc. 
5. Add animations in ASCII - art. Find an efficient way to do this. 
6. Clean up code to take music, ascii art as input from /data folder.
